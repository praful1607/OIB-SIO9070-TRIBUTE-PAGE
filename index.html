        <h3>Early Life</h3>
        <p>Born in Delhi on 23 August 1968 to Malayali parents, Krishnakumar Kunnath grew up in New Delhi. He sang 3,500 jingles before breaking into Bollywood.KK attended Delhi's Mount St Mary's School, and Kirori Mal College, Delhi University. He made an appearance in the song "Josh of India", released to support the Indian Cricket Team during the 1999 Cricket World Cup. KK married Jyothy in 1991. His son Nakul Krishna Kunnath sang the song "Masti" from his album Humsafar with him. KK also had a daughter.</p>

        <h3>Career</h3>
        <p>After graduating in commerce from Kirori Mal College, KK did a six-month stint as a marketing executive before pursuing his passion for music.

        <h3>Vocals and musical style</h3>
        <p>KK did not have any formal training in music. According to film director Mahesh Bhatt, "KK had an emotional bandwidth which echoed all the seasons of the heart. He could be frivolous, romantic and anguished. He could go into the depths, talk about the wonder and magic of life."KK emphasized that it is not important for a singer's face to be prominently seen; he believed the important thing was that "a singer must be heard". In a 2019 interview, KK said he felt comfortable with the microphone but awkward in front of a camera. He valued and "fiercely" protected his privacy. In his playback songs, KK never wanted his singing to be associated with any particular actor and preferred singing for diverse actors.</p>

He was rushed to Calcutta Medical Research Institute (CMRI) at around 10:30 pm, where he was declared dead. He was 53 years old at the time of his death.
        On 1 June 2022, Kolkata Police registered a case of unnatural death to investigate the cause. His autopsy was videographed. The autopsy report mentioned myocardial infarction (heart attack) as the likely cause of death. The report ruled out any foul play. According to the doctor who conducted the autopsy, KK could have survived if he had received cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) immediately after falling unconscious. He had experienced pain in his shoulder and arm in his last few days and had informed his wife about his condition. He mistook the cause to be digestive issues and was consuming antacids; on his last day, he had again complained of pain. According to the autopsy report, his heart had 80% blockage.
        Three Public Interest Litigation (PIL)s related to his death were registered in the Calcutta High Court and are pending a hearing.

His remains were then brought to Mumbai and his funeral was held at the Versova Hindu Cemetery on the following day, 2 June. It was attended by family members, friends and colleagues.</p>
        <p>Deccan Herald called him the "voice of love" while reporting his death. According to The Times of India, he was the most versatile singer in the Bollywood music industry. The Hindu noted, "Till the end, he remained a rage in the concert circuit and will be remembered as the singer who became the voice of the heart".</p>
        
        <h3>Awards and honors</h3>
        <p>In a Hindustan Times interview, KK was asked if getting nominated for several awards but winning only a few bothered him. </p>
        <p>KK replied that it did not, adding, <i>"As a singer, I haven't felt any lesser by not getting an award. Winning or not winning an award doesn't affect me. I just like to do my work in the best possible manner. I am happy getting good songs. I am happy not getting awards."</i></p>
